/**
 * Service Provider Interface (SPI) for resolving cryptographic keys from various sources.
 *
 * <p>This interface enables a pluggable key resolution strategy, allowing the framework to resolve
 * keys from different backends without coupling to any specific implementation. Each {@code
 * KeyResolver} implementation handles a specific type of key source (e.g., local key store, remote
 * JWKS endpoint, file system, external KMS).
 *
 * <p><b>Design Pattern:</b> Strategy Pattern + Chain of Responsibility
 *
 * <p>Multiple {@code KeyResolver} implementations can be registered in the application context. The
 * framework iterates through them in order, using the first resolver that {@linkplain
 * #supports(KeyDefinition) supports} the given key definition.
 *
 * <p><b>Built-in Implementations:</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link JwksConsumerKeyResolver} — resolves keys from remote JWKS endpoints
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see KeyDefinition
 * @see JwksConsumerKeyResolver
